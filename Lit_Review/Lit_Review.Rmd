Literature Review 
==========================

#### Brandsema, P.S., ect. 

Investigation into an outbreak from August to September 2010 in the Netherlands. A strong association was found between high temperature and precipitation and the outbreak. The study also referenced another paper that investigated an outbreak in the Netherlands in 2006 and the paper also found an association between temperature and precipitation and the outbreak. 

LD incubation period is 2-10 days but can sometimes be a max of 19 days. This study looked at a 14 day incubation period. Optimum temperature range for the bacteria is 25-25 degrees Celcius. 

"Meteorological data were obtained from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) for the weather station in De Bilt". The variables analyzed were the mean weekly value for temperature, relative humidity, cloudiness, precipitation, and rainfall intensity. Analyzation of the data was done through an extended Poisson regression model. 

Used percentiles


#### Fisman

Analyzed month of occurence of case, not onset date. Stated that onset time for LD is 2-10 days

meteorological data were obtained from airport weather stations in
Montgomery County (Willow Grove Naval Air Station) and
Philadelphia County (Philadelphia International Airport)

#### Halsby 

Weather data were obtained from Met Office Land
Surface Observation Stations Data (‘MIDAS’ – Met
Office Integrated Data Archive System) held by the
British Atmospheric Data Centre

temperature by a linear threshold
model, with the threshold at the 25th centile (11·35 °C;
lag 0–9 weeks)




Quality analysis of data
===================

Overall I recommend not using London or Miyazaki. These locations have too much missing data and riem_networks does not contain the data required. Riem doesn't have data from earlier dates nor does weather underground.

#### TMIN and TMAX

Sarsborg is missing this data from around December 1995 to around May 1999. I checked the minimum temperature on the 2002-12-31 where the min was -26 C. However, I cross checked this with weather underground and general record temperatures for Sarpsborg and have not found an agreeing source. We may be able ot obtain data from 1996 and later. 


Bovenkarspel is missing temperatures from the start to around July 1990. Weather Underground does not provide data back this far
