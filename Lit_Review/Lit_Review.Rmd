Literature Review 
==========================

#### Brandsema 

LD incubation period is 2-10 days but can sometimes be a max of 19 days. This study looked at a 14 day incubation period. 

"Meteorological data were obtained from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) for the weather station in De Bilt". The variables analyzed were the mean weekly value for temperature, relative humidity, cloudiness, precipitation, and rainfall intensity.

Used percentiles

Found temperature but not humidity or precipitation was associated 

#### Fisman

Analyzed month of occurence of case, not onset date. Stated that onset time for LD is 2-10 days

meteorological data were obtained from airport weather stations in
Montgomery County (Willow Grove Naval Air Station) and
Philadelphia County (Philadelphia International Airport)

#### Halsby 

Weather data were obtained from Met Office Land
Surface Observation Stations Data (‘MIDAS’ – Met
Office Integrated Data Archive System) held by the
British Atmospheric Data Centre

temperature by a linear threshold

lag 0–9 weeks)




Quality analysis of data
===================

#### TMIN and TMAX

Sarsborg is missing this data from around December 1996 to around May 1999
